- Any code editor (VS Code, Visual Studio 2022 recommended)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/EnesKaraca44/BerberOto.git
    cd BerberOto
    ```

2.  **Restore dependencies:**
    ```bash
    dotnet restore
    ```

3.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    dotnet run
    ```
    The application will automatically create the SQLite database (`BerberOto.db`) and seed initial data if configured.

4.  **Access the app:**
    Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` (or the port specified in the console).

## ⚙️ Configuration

Start by checking `appsettings.json` for configuration settings.

```json
{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "Microsoft.AspNetCore": "Warning"
    }
  },
  "AllowedHosts": "*"
}
```

To enable real SMS sending, you may need to configure the `ISmsService` implementation in `Program.cs` to use `NetgsmSmsService` instead of `LogSmsService`.
